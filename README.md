# chatbot-demo

This repo shows a demo of a simple Customer Service chatbot. It's powered by IBM Watson Conversation/Assistant service and based on the web client from Botmaster [http://botmasterai.com].

To start this application, first change the environment variables in the file ".env" to your Watson API Key and the Watson Assistant Workspace/Skill ID.

Then run the following:
1. ```npm install```
2. ```node server.js```

Then open in a browser ```http://0.0.0.0:3000``` and start chatting.
